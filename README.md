### üéØ **Learning Goals**

The main objective is to understand the fundamentals of web scraping, from making simple HTTP requests to handling complex, dynamic websites. The key goals are:

-   Learn to parse HTML and extract data using **Beautiful Soup**.
-   Scrape data from APIs.
-   Understand ethical scraping practices and respect `robots.txt`.
